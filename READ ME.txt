I have tried to use another device to run my program, realize that there will have an error if the way to open the program is incorrect.
**To run the program successfully:**
1) do not unzip the zip file first
2) open netbeans
3) then unzip the zip file
4) in netbeans, open project, select the unzipped folder
5) find customer_login.java
6) run the file
